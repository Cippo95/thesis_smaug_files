#Configs folder
It contains smv-accel.cfg the configuration of partitioning (size of registers)
and optimization to do on the code to use the parallelism on functional units
(loop unrolling, pipeline, flattening) and CACTI files to extimate power
consumption from memories.

#SMAUG folder
I use the same folder structure of smaug, copying my modified files for
different configurations of processing elements and fixes to the code algorithm. 

I have already proposed the changes to the devs in emails but they want a pull 
request, I will try to do it when I have free time, I'm not really that used to 
GitHub.
