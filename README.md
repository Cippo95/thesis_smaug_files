#SMAUG thesis

Welcome to this repository where I share my test results and configuration 
files.

#Folders content
networks: networks used in my thesis, their script and protobuf files.
scripts: my scripts and files to analyze the simulations.
src: smaug sources to achieve the hardware configurations used in simulation.
tests: simultation files that I think are worth uploading on the networks.

In my docker image I have a "sims" folder with all the files from the 
simulations.
My reasoning about uploading just "tests" is because of size limits on GitHub:
it complains with files over 100MB and a repository can be 1GB of size I think.

I think that with all the configuration files that I'm uploading you can 
replicate my tests pretty easily.
