# Files produced using SMAUG for my thesis

Here I share my simulation results and configuration files.

# Folders content

- networks: networks used in my simulations.
- scripts: scripts and files to analyze the simulations.
- src: SMAUG sources modified for different configurations.
- tests: stats from different networks and configurations.

With the files uploaded here you should be able to reproduce my tests.
